# vkeys-to-json
Converts VSCO Keys files from the old vkeys format to the json format. 

## Why?
Because VSCO encrypted the old file format, and you probably have .vkeys files you'd like to use with the new open source version.

## Notes
I haven't done anything except throwing this in a .sh file for personal usage, as I have tons of keymaps I'd like to use. All credit to [@nsfmc](https://github.com/nsfmc) for somehow managing to figure this out:
